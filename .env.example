# Batching Configuration
# Gas per ft_transfer call (conservative estimate: 10 TGas)
FT_TRANSFER_GAS=3000000000000

# Gas per storage_deposit call (5 TGas)
STORAGE_DEPOSIT_GAS=5000000000000

MAX_TRANSACTION_GAS=300000000000000

# Batch timeout in milliseconds (flush batch every 500ms)
BATCH_TIMEOUT_MS=500

# Cache Configuration
# Cache TTL for account validation checks in seconds (30 minutes)
CACHE_TTL_SECONDS=1800

# Account Existence Verification
# Should we check if the account exists on the blockchain before transferring tokens?
# Enabling it is a good and safe default, but it adds additional RPC call, so additional latency.
# When disabling it, the transfer to non-existing accounts will be successfully executed, so you may
# want to validate the receiver account on the upstream service anyway, so it might be redundant to
# do this double-verification.
ENSURE_RECEIVER_ACCOUNT_EXISTS=true

# Storage Deposit Behavior
# AUTO_STORAGE_DEPOSIT controls whether to automatically handle storage deposits
# true = automatically deposit storage for receivers without it (seamless UX, costs relayer)
# false = reject transfers if receiver doesn't have storage deposit (fail-fast, manual setup required)
AUTO_STORAGE_DEPOSIT=true

# Retry Configuration
# Maximum number of automatic retry attempts for actions in failed batches
# When a batch transaction fails at a specific action, other actions are automatically retried
MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS=3

# API Configuration
API_PORT=3030
